I am following The Odin Project and currently doing the Web Development 101 course.  I am creating this file as a history of my progress.
To get to this point I have:
    • Set a repository on GitHub.
    • Created this README.md file from the command line using - touch README.md
    • Added the README.md file to the staging area from the command line using - git add -m README.md
    • Commited the file to my local repository from the command using - git commit -m "Add README.md"
    • Pushed the file to my GitHub repository from the command using - git push origin master
    • Edited README.md file describing what I have done so far.
    • Committed and pushed changes to local and GitHub repositories.
